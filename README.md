Bioinformatics is an elective course for final year Biochemistry students at KNUST, but it is often seen as unattractive due to limited knowledge about the field and its opportunities. This project involves designing a computer program to help students appreciate bioinformatics. 
This purpose of this project is to design a program that assesses and provides materials to the student in the areas of bioinformatics and computational  biology.
The program initially welcomes the student and takes studenst's information.
It then test the students's knowledge with bioinformatics after which it would score the student.
The program would recommend resources for bioinformatics and significance of bioinformatics
The students goes through a short test and given a feedback as well as appreciation for using the program after which a set set of recommended resources would be displayed to the students for his or her perusal.
